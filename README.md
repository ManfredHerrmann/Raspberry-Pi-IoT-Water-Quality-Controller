A Raspberry Pi based modular controller that can be used for process water treatment, hydroponics, reef tanks and similar applications.

## Overview
This is currently a work in progress repository inspired by [reef-pi](https://github.com/reef-pi/reef-pi). There's a great write up on that project over at [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/search?q=reef-pi). This one is a variation on the them better suited to what I'm doing.
