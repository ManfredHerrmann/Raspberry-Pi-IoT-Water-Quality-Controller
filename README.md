# Raspberry Pi IoT Water Quality Controller
A Raspberry Pi based controller that can be used for process water treatment, hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics, reef tanks and similar applications.

## Overview
This is currently a work in progress repository inspired by [reef-pi](https://github.com/reef-pi/reef-pi). There's a great write up on that project over at [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/search?q=reef-pi). 

This is simply a variation on the same theme that's better suited to what I'm doing. Rather than a web interface, this is  Python based so it can exchange information via MQTT and other protocols.
